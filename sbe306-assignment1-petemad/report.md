    * What is _static_ in **static int** line.
    * what is **GLfloat** type. Is it a regular float ? what is the difference ?
    * Is it possible to start this code from scratch ? or it is advanced some how ?!
    * If it is possible please! take in consideration to talk about how to start and how to think in our tutorial.
